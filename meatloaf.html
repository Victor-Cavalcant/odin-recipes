    <ul>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup plain dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>10 slices provolone cheese</li>
        <h4>For the blood sauce:</h4>
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <li>
            <h4>step</h4>
            <p>Combine ground beef, salt, pepper, cayenne, green onions, parsley, bread crumbs, egg, and Worcestershire
                sauce in a large bowl. Mix with a fork until just combined; do not overmix. Wrap and chill in the
                refrigerator for 1 hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>step 2</h4>
            <p>Combine cream cheese and Cheddar cheese in a bowl and season filling with salt and pepper. Spoon filling
                into jalapeno halves</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>step 3</h4>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with a silicone liner (such as
                Silpat®).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>step 4</h4>
            <p>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until cooked through, about 20 minutes. An instant-read
                thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 150 degrees F (66 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>step 5</h4>
            <p>Remove from the oven and immediately place a slice of provolone cheese on the top of each ghost,
                centering it the best you can. Cut the remaining 2 slices of provolone into quarters and place those
                over the center to provide more cheese for the head. The residual heat from the meat will start to melt
                the cheese and it will droop down.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>step 6</h4>
            <p>Return to the oven until the cheese melts, 30 to 60 seconds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>step 7</h4>
            <p>Remove from the oven and take some of the melted cheese around the bottoms and wrap and drape it back up
                over the heads. Use the tip of a knife to form eyes and mouths, then neaten up the bottom of the cheese
                "sheets."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>step 8</h4>
            <p>Combine ketchup, barbecue sauce, and Sriracha for blood sauce; ladle onto plates and serve meatloaf
                ghosts on top.p>
        </li>
    </ol>
